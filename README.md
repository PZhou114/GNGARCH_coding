# GNGARCH_coding

This repository includes the codes I have used for the simulation and implementation of my Master's thesis: A new implementation of network GARCH Model, all plots and parameter fitting results are included in these notebook files.

Specifically, 'Model simulation and parameter fitting.ipynb' is the file for the reproduction of Section 3: GNGARCH Model Specification and Simulation; 'Modelling Most-Active US Stocks.ipynb' is the file for the reproduction of Section 4: Modelling Most-Active US Stocks, and the 'Appendix.ipynb' is the file for Appendix. Note that some figures and tables containing the parameter fitting results come from the other two .ipynb files.

These files also allow you to test the model with different settings. For example, you can choose different random seeds (rather than default 0) in 'Model simulation and parameter fitting.ipynb' for model simulaiton, and examine the model conditional variance and covariance among different stocks (rather than default NVDA) in 'Modelling Most-Active US Stocks.ipynb', by just changing corresponding variables in the respective functions.

Hope you can use the codes successfully to see the necessary figures and parameter fitting results. If there are any unclarity please email: peiyi.zhou21@imperial.ac.uk.
